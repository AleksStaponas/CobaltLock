## Safety Features

- **Safe Decrypt Option:** Instantly restores files to prevent damage during testing.  
- **Reverse Shell:** Runs via Windows CMD for controlled simulation and has a connector for testing.  
- **Limited Impact:** Only files in a safe test folder are affected.

## Windows10FakeUpdate  
A fake Windows update screen used as a distraction that encrypts discovered files and estimates a time so it is ready and not as alarming to users. Furthermore, this behaviour can often be related to other malware types, such as viruses, that use that time to spread through vulnerabilities such as zero-days, or even install rootkits onto a compromised machine.

## InitialPhase  
Initial lock screen phase with timer and shell connection. This is demonstrated as it is often used in real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and is commonly shown in attackers' OPSEC operations, which they can use to further escalate privileges or obfuscate logs.

## SecondPhase  
Critical phase with timer and increased demands, file deletion if requirements are met with simulated payment code. If demands are not met, this ethical ransomware runs a wipedown where the user's encrypted files are deleted, simulating similar behaviours to the NotPetya ransomware that would delete a compromised machine's files. In this case, it is simulated and only targets files in a specific directory.

# Current isues
The current file discovery process fails when the specified path includes a directory. Once it encounters a directory, it is unable to encrypt any files contained within its subdirectories.
